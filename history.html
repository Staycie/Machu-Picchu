                - Tucked away in the rocky countryside northwest of Cuzco, Peru, Machu Picchu is believed to have been a royal
                estate or sacred religious site for Inca leaders, whose civilization was virtually wiped out by Spanish 
                invaders in the 16th century. For hundreds of years, until the American archaeologist Hiram Bingham stumbled 
                upon it in 1911, the abandoned citadel’s existence was a secret known only to peasants living in the region. 
                The site stretches over an impressive 5-mile distance, featuring more than 3,000 stone steps that link its 
                many different levels. Today, hundreds of thousands of people tramp through Machu Picchu every year, braving 
                crowds and landslides to see the sun set over its towering stone monuments and marvel at the mysterious 
                splendor of one of the world’s most famous manmade wonders.
            

                <b>Machu Picchu’s Inca Past</b>

                - Historians believe Machu Picchu was built at the height of the Inca Empire, which dominated western South America 
                in the 15th and 16th centuries. It was abandoned an estimated 100 years after its construction, probably around the 
                time the Spanish began their conquest of the mighty pre-Columbian civilization in the 1530s. There is no evidence 
                that the conquistadors ever attacked or even reached the mountaintop citadel, however; for this reason, some have 
                suggested that the residents’ desertion occurred because of a smallpox epidemic.


                <b>Machu Picchu’s “Discovery” by Hiram Bingham</b>

                - In the summer of 1911 the American archaeologist Hiram Bingham arrived in Peru with a small team of explorers hoping 
                to find Vilcabamba, the last Inca stronghold to fall to the Spanish. Traveling on foot and by mule, Bingham and his 
                team made their way from Cuzco into the Urubamba Valley, where a local farmer told them of some ruins located at the 
                top of a nearby mountain. The farmer called the mountain Machu Picchu, which translates to “old peak” in the native 
                Quechua language. On July 24, after a tough climb to the mountain’s ridge in cold and drizzly weather, Bingham met a 
                small group of peasants who showed him the rest of the way. Led by an 11-year-old boy, Bingham got his first glimpse 
                of the intricate network of stone terraces marking the entrance to Machu Picchu.
